This is a part of Cool R Things series made purely for educational purposes. Contains both .rmd file and the notebook.

In this series i demonstrate various things that R allows us to do from web scraping, building dashboards, creating maps and many more.

I explore the realm of ```web scraping```, utilizing the robust ```rvest``` library. Web scraping is a method for extracting valuable data from websites, and the rvest library, specifically designed for R, offers a comprehensive set of functions tailored for working with ```HTML``` and ```XML``` documents.
